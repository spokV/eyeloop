One of EyeLoopâ€™s most appealing applications is closed-loop experiments (Fig). To demonstrate this, we designed an extractor to use the pupil area to modulate the brightness of a monitor, in effect a reciprocal feedback loop: Here, the light reflex causes the pupil to dilate in dim settings, which causes the extractor to increase monitor brightness. In turn, this causes the pupil to constrict, causing the extractor to decrease brightness and return the experiment to its initial state.

The brightness formula contains four critical variables (Fig B): The rate of change, I, which is dependent on the pupil area, and its scalar, q. The velocity, v, which applies the rate of change to monitor brightness, and, the velocity friction, f, which decays the velocity towards zero. Interestingly, by varying these parameters, we observe behaviors characteristic of dynamical systems: For the reference and the slow decay trials, we find emergent limit-cycle oscillations (Fig C). This dynamic is dramatically impaired by a small scalar, and abolished in the low rate trial. These findings illustrate how a simple closed-loop experiment may generate self-sustaining dynamics emerging from the eyes engaging with the system, and the system engaging with the eyes.

## How to reproduce ##
In *run_eyeloop.py*, import the closed-loop *Extractor* module and the *calibrator*:
```python
from eyeloop.extractors.closed_loop import ClosedLoop_Extractor
from eyeloop.extractors.calibration import Calibration_Extractor
```

First, load the *calibrator*:
```python
ENGINE.load_extractors(Calibration_Extractor())
```

  </p>

Position a PC monitor in front of the eye of the subject, turn off the lights and run the experiment.
```
eyeloop
```

> Note: Adjust the width, height and x, y coordinates of the visual stimulus (inside calibration.py, closed_loop.py to fit your setup.

This returns a calibration value (saved in file format ```{time_stamp}._cal_```). Now, load the closed-loop *Extractor* and paste this value inside ```{time_stamp}._cal_``` as the first parameter:
```python
ENGINE.load_extractors(ClosedLoop_Extractor(_CAL_))
```

For example,

```python
ENGINE.load_extractors(ClosedLoop_Extractor(794.58))
```

That's it! Enjoy your experiment.

> Note: If you're using a Vimba-based camera, use command ```eyeloop --importer vimba```
